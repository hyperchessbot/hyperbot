# Welcome to Hyper Bot !
## Create your own permanent Hyper Bot ( runs on Heroku, no Lc0 )
If you want to create your own permanent bot, do the following:  
  
Sign up to GitHub https://github.com/join , if you have not already.  
  
With your GitHub account visit https://github.com/hyperchessbot/hyperbot , then click on Fork.  
  
Create a BOT account if you do not already have one. To create one use an account that has not played any games yet, log into this account, then visit https://hypereasy.herokuapp.com/auth/lichess/bot , approve oauth and then on the page you are taken to click on 'Request upgrade to bot'.  
  
Create an API access token with your BOT account at https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token ( should have scopes Read incoming challenges / Create, accept, decline challenges / Play games with the bot API )  
  
Sign up to Heroku https://signup.heroku.com/ , if you have not already.  
  
At Heroku create a new app using New / Create new app. Choose Europe for region.  
  
In the app's dashboard go to the Deploy tab. Use the GitHub button to connect the app to your forked repo. Press Search to find your repositories, then select hyperbot. You need to deploy the master branch. Enable Automatic Deploys and press Deploy Branch, for the initial deploy. Wait for the build to finish.  
  
In Heroku Settings / Reveal Config Vars create a new variable TOKEN and set its value to your newly created access token, then create a new variable BOT_NAME and set its value to your bot's lichess username.  
  
For more detailed instructions and screenshots on setting up your Heroku app refer to this Wiki https://github.com/hyperchessbot/hyperbot/wiki/Creating-and-configuring-your-app-on-Heroku#creating-and-configuring-your-app-on-heroku .  
  
Congratulations, you have an up and running lichess bot.

## Config vars
**KEEP_ALIVE_URL** : set this to the full link of your bot home page ( https://[yourappname].herokuapp.com , where change [yourappname] to your Heroku app name ) if you want your bot to be kept alive from early morning till late night Heroku server time, keeping alive a free Heroku bot for 24/7 is not possible, because a free Heroku account has a monthly quota of 550 hours  
  
**ALWAYS_ON** : requires paid Heroku account, set it to 'true' to keep the bot alive 24/7, you have to set KEEP_ALIVE_URL to your bot's full home page link for ALWAYS_ON to work ( see also the explanation of KEEP_ALIVE_URL config var )  
  
**ALLOW_CORRESPONDENCE** : set it to 'true' to allow playing correspondence and infinite time control games
